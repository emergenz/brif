## Status-quo

- Summarizers: Blinkist, Soundview, GetAbstract

- Blinkist only has 4500 titles. but over 18 million users (paying 13 euros per month each!!) WHY??

- Employees take at least week to read, analyze and summarize books

## Our Solution

- AI based app to summarize books
- PITCH HERE
- zero-cost-business-model; we don't even need to buy the rights of the books
- Server cheaper that a single employees salary
- can summarize more books in a week than blinkist ever did
- Summaries of your favourite books basically for free! 
- But thats just the beginning, business plan is the real game changer

## Business Plan
-  we're going to start with a basic, ever expanding database of book summaries (which will surpass blinkists repertoire in a week!)
- users are able to rate the summaries on a scale from 1 to 10
- rating is used to make the AI even better via reinforcement learning with human input
- there is no way, that blinkist is going to survive this. This means that we will be able to buy blinkist in 5 months.
- after the acquisition of blinkist, we will have a repertoire of 4500 human-written titles, which we will use to further train the AI

- this will give us such a head-start on the competition that we will essentially dominate the market without any chance of competitors catching up
- our technology is essentially scalable till infinity
