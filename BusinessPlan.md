# TITLE: Brif Notes

- only the beginning, business plan (game plan) is the actual game changeer
- (almost) zero-cost-business-model; we don't even need to buy the rights of the books
- we're going to start with a basic, ever expanding database of book summaries (which will surpass blinkists repertoire in a DAY!)
- users are able to rate the summaries on a scale from 1 to 10
- rating is used to make the AI even better via reinforcement learning with human input
- there is no way, that blinkist is going to survive this. This means that we will at some point (need to specify more accurately) be able to buy blinkist
- after the acquisition of blinkist, we will have a repertoire of 4500 human-written titles, which we will use to further train the AI
- this will give us such a head-start on the competition that we will essentially dominate the market without any chance of competitors catching up


- blinkist only has 4500 titles, but over 18 million users (that are paying 13 euros per month each!!)
- our technology is essentially scalable til infinity
